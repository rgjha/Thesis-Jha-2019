This is the format required by Syracuse University for the PhD thesis.

1) All the figures are to be included inside ./Figures. This will mean that when
you declare the figure (abc.png) in the tex file -> it should be like ./Figures/abc.png 

The head.tex is the place where your title, name etc. will go. 

2) I've organized the papers in various chapters inside the "Chapters" directory  

3) The main file is - thesis.tex


To run : open terminal and do "bash ./run_draft.sh"
We compile it several times so that it picks up all references/links/hyperlinks etc.
