I am thankful to my advisor Simon Catterall for his support, encouragement, and numerous conversations during which I learned how to 
think about a problem in Physics. He has also instilled in me, a taste for - intuition and simplicity, 
and to see the Physics rather than getting fazed by unimportant details. 
He gave me two of his invited talks at YITP Kyoto (probably the best time of the year during sakura!) 
and ICTS Bangalore. He has been very patient with me and let me work mostly on my own in the last few years. 
I have greatly benefited from my interactions with Toby Wiseman, who explained to me various things
over our numerous Skype calls and in person at Kyoto. His approach towards solving a problem and finding 
opportunities in despair have taught me a lot. I am thankful to Joel Giedt for multiple interactions 
and wonderful suggestions which has immensely contributed to my development.  
I have also spent time working with Jack Laiho on Euclidean dynamical triangulations and would like to thank
him. When I started working on lattice supersymmetric theories, 
I was fortunate to have David Schaich (359 PB) in the office next to me and I 
have learned a lot from him and would like to thank him. In the last two years, I have enjoyed multiple discussions on tensor networks and table-tennis 
games with Judah F. Unmuth-Yockey and would like him to thank him. I would like to thank Jay Hubisz, Cristian Armendariz-Picon 
for courses during the first two years. I am also thankful to Carl Rosenzweig who was the instructor for my first TA class 
(PHY 101 labs!) in the Fall of 2013 and for his reminiscences about QCD from the 1970s during our weekly group meetings.
I am thankful to Anosh Joseph, Masanori Hanada, Ethan Neil for
making arrangements for my talk at ICTS Bangalore, YITP Kyoto, and UC Boulder in the past two years.  

I would like to thank Bikram Phookun, Vikram Vyas, and Abhinav Gupta for undergraduate Physics classes at  
St. Stephen's College, Delhi (2007-2010). I am grateful to Shobhana Narasimhan for her support during my time
in Bangalore (2009-2010). For one year in the past 12 years (2010-2011), 
I worked on nano-materials and related topics at UPMC, Paris.
I interacted with M. Marangolo, N. Witkowski, F. Mauri, and M. Calandra during that year and would like
to thank them for their help and apologize for my performance. For my time in Calcutta (2011-2013), 
I am especially thankful to Shibaji Banerjee, Sarbari Guha, and Suparna Roychowdhury and my friends during that time - 
Ripon, Soumen, Arghajit, Dibyajyoti, Sangita, Soumyadeep. 

I would like to thank my undergraduate friends (in random order) who have now been friends for 
more than ten years: Bahul, Uddipta, Anjishnu, Soumyodipto, Rajarshi, Rahul, Parul, Varun, Ravi Kunjwal, Debayan, Arijit, and Chitraleema. 
Though I met them all for the first time in Delhi, the last time I met them was either in New York, Paris, Athens, 
Berlin, Austin, Toronto, or London. I would like to thank set of friends after August 2013 (in random order) : 
Prashant, Nouman, Sudipta, Prabesh, Francesco, Suraj Shankar, Swetha, Aarti, Bithika, Jayanth,  
Gizem, Cem, Scott, Mahesh, Asad, and Sourav. 
A friend in Syracuse with whom I have spent long hours working in offices next to each other (361 and 363 PB) \footnote{
For curious reader: The room numbers $n$ on 3rd floor facing the Archbold Gymnasium are $\textit{n}$ mod 2 = 1} in 
the department is Ogan \"{O}zsoy. I greatly enjoyed our discussions and would like to thank him. I would like to thank my parents for 
believing in me and encouraging me at every step in my life and teaching me the value of education and allowing me 
to pursue basic sciences instead of more lucrative professional careers also available to me in 2007. 
I would like to thank my wife, Kriti, who has dealt well with a person like me.
This thesis won't have been possible without their love and warmth. 
I would also like to thank A.R. Rahman for his compositions which have comforted me through the toughest of times. 
I wish him Bharat Ratna in the future. I am sorry for other wonderful people whom I might have missed to mention here, 
for they will know that my affection and gratitude is not just restricted to this space.
