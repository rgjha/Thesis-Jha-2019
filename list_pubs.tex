\noindent The following research publications have not been included in the thesis due to their disjoint research field (as of this writing) to the main theme of the dissertation work or 
because of their DOI (Digital object identifier) nature (such as, conference proceedings) :

\begin{enumerate}
\item Tensor renormalization group study of the non-Abelian Higgs model in two dimensions [\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11443}{1901.11443}}}]  
 \item  Lattice quantum gravity with scalar fields [\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09946}{1810.09946}}}]
  \item Truncation of lattice $\mathcal{N}$ = 4 super Yang-Mills [\href{https://doi.org/10.1051/epjconf/201817511008}{EPJ Web of Conferences 175, 11008 (2018)}]
